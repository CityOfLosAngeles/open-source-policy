# Introduction
*DRAFT*

The City of Los Angeles has an interest in pursuing open source software development and related policy.
This policy recommends licensing, provides contact information, and provides guidance for said policy.

## Why Open Source 

Releasing open source software, websites, and content promises many benefits for the City of Los Angeles,
including reducing duplicative work, increasing internal efficiency, improving recruiting,
bolstering community engagement, and demonstrating leadership among other cities.

One of the principal benefits to municipalities from releasing open source software is in aligning different city departments.
There may be more than one department interested in creating software with a particular function
(e.g., website templates, data standards, and style guides).
Open sourcing software is an ideal way to ensure multiple users
can collaborate on or adapt one another's work without having to create the same thing twice.
When multiple City stakeholders are collaborating on a software project,
open sourcing decreases development time as users are able to suggest changes continuously.

Additionally, by open sourcing our code, analyses, websites, and other content,
we make it possible for residents and other cities to adapt, reuse, and contribute to the City.

Benefits of open source may be summarized as:
* Reduction of duplicated work
* Enhanced internal collaboration
* Automatic CPRA compliance
* Recruiting
* Leadership among other cities
* Community engagement
* Trust in government


The City itself uses a host of open source projects from
[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
Open source has many [advantages for government bodies](http://www.govtech.com/opinion/6-Benefits-of-Using-Open-Source-Software-in-Government.html).

## Example Projects 
### City 
* [DOT Planner](https://github.com/datala/dot-planner)- ITA and DOT collaborated on a planning tool for Active Transportation Projects which has since been adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments as a standard.
* [Mayor's Dashboard](https://github.com/datala/bradley-tower)
* [Department of Cultural Affairs Social Media Policy](https://github.com/dcadigital)

### Other Governments
* [Food Inspection Analysis](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation)
* [18F Open Source](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy)
* [CA Department of Health and Human Services](https://github.com/chhsdata)

## Engaging The Community 
Consider making a presentation at a local meetup about your open source code.
This can drive community engagement with your code.
We've found these groups are responsive to having members from the City teams speak.
Additionally, these meetings serve as an excellent recruiting tool for getting help with a project or new ideas.

Some meetups: 

* [Hack for LA](http://hackforla.org) 
* [LA Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/RMDS_LA/) 
* [LA Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/socalpython/)
* [LA PHP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/laphpdev/)
* [JS.LA](http://js.la/)
* [Hacks/Hackers]()

## Licensing
The City does not mandate publishing under a specific license. We recommend using Apache, GPL, or MIT licenses for software.
For non-software content that you want to publish, please use a [CC-BY](https://choosealicense.com/non-software/) license.
Please check [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) for more information about tradeoffs between licenses.

### GitHub
The City has a shared [GitHub organization](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles) under the name "CityOfLosAngeles".
It is collectively administered by its users.
We recommend that you publish code and use repositories under that organization, rather than fragmenting them by using personal accounts.
Contact [Hunter Owens](mailto://hunter.owens@lacity.org) or [Maryam Abbassi](mailto://maryam.abbassi@lacity.org) to get started.

For help with creating a GitHub account, please open a SNow ticket with the CloudOps team. 

A department may wish to create an independent organization instead of publishing on the main `CityOfLosAngeles` page.
In that case, please make sure to comply with the policies laid out on the [Reuse](./reuse.md) page.
We encourage using a shared organization with many different teams to manage access and commit rights.

### Checklist
Before open-sourcing a project, we recommend completing the City's open source [checklist](./checklist.md). However, it is an anti-pattern to start projects as closed source, it is considered best practice to be open from the start. Your first commit can and should be the items on the checklist! 

### Open Source Teams

The default position of any team that wishes to designate itself an open source team in the City of LA shall be 

1. Use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.
2. Develop our work in the open.
3. Publish publicly all source code created or modified by said team, whether developed in-house or by external collaborators.

#### Exceptions to working in the open 


The only conditions where code shall not be developed and released in the open are:

* The City does not have the rights to reproduce and release the item.

* The public release of the item is restricted by other law or regulation.

These decisions will be made as needed by the relevent team, which will review the conditions under which code will not be made available publicly. Any further exemptions will be rare, documented publicly, and the result of compelling interest.

If an existing solution cannot be found in the open source community, an open source team may consider other options, including creating an open source solution itself. Ultimately, the software that best meets the needs and mission of the City should be used.
