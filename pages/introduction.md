The City of Los Angeles has a vest interst in persuing a open source code development and source code policy. This policy recommends licensing, provides contact information and guidance for said policy. 

## Why Open Source 
By open sourcing our code and analysis, websites and content, we make it possible for residents and other cities to adapt, reuse and contribute to the City. 

The City itself uses a whole host of open source projects, from Drupal to Open Street Map. Open source has many [advantages for government bodies](http://www.govtech.com/opinion/6-Benefits-of-Using-Open-Source-Software-in-Government.html). 

## Example Projects 
### City Specific 
* [DOT Planner](https://github.com/datala/dot-planner)- ITA and DOT collaborated on a planner 
* [Mayor's Dashboard](https://github.com/datala/bradley-tower)

### Other Governments
* [Food Inspection Analysis](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation)
* [18F Open Source](https://github.com/)
* [CA Department of Health and Human Services](https://github.com/chhsdata)



## Engaging The Community 
Consider making a presentation at a local meetup about your open source code. 

## Licensing
The City does not mandate publishing under a specific license. We support using Apache, GPL or MIT licenses for software. For non-software content you which to open-source, please use a [cc-by](https://choosealicense.com/non-software/) license. Please check [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) for more details. 

## Logistics 
### Github
The City supports a shared [github account](https://github.com/datala) under the heading organization "DataLA". It is collectively adminsitrated by its users. We recommend that you publish code and use repositories under the organization rather than fracturing it by using personal accounts. Contact [Hunter Owens](mailto://hunter.owens@lacity.org) or [Maryam Abbassi](mailto://maryam.abbassi@lacity.org) to get started.
