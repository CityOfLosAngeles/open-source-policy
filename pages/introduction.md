*DRAFT*

The City of Los Angeles has a vested interest in pursuing open source code development and related policy. This policy recommends licensing, provides contact information, and guidance for said policy. 

## Why Open Source 

Releasing open source software, websites, and content promises many benefits for the City of Los Angeles, including reducing duplicative work, increasing internal efficiency, improving recruiting, bolstering community engagement, and demonstrating leadership among other cities. 

One of the principal benefits to municipalities of releasing open source software is in aligning different city departments. Because there may be more than one department interested in creating software with a particular function (e.g., website templates, data standards, style guides), open sourcing is an ideal way to ensure multiple users can collaborate on or adopt one another's work without having to create the same thing twice. When multiple City stakeholders are collaborating on a software project, open sourcing decreases development time as users are able to suggest changes continuously.

Leadership among other cities

Community engagement
Trust in Government

By open sourcing our code and analysis, websites, and content, we make it possible for residents and other cities to adapt, reuse, and contribute to the City. 

The City itself uses a host of open source projects from Drupal to OpenStreetMap. Open source has many [advantages for government bodies](http://www.govtech.com/opinion/6-Benefits-of-Using-Open-Source-Software-in-Government.html). 

## Example Projects 
### City 
* [DOT Planner](https://github.com/datala/dot-planner)- ITA and DOT collaborated on a planning tool for Active Transporatation Projects that has since been adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments as a standard. 
* [Mayor's Dashboard](https://github.com/datala/bradley-tower)
* [Department of Cultural Affairs Social Media Policy](https://github.com/dcadigital)

### Other Governments
* [Food Inspection Analysis](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation)
* [18F Open Source](https://github.com/)
* [CA Department of Health and Human Services](https://github.com/chhsdata)

## Engaging The Community 
Consider making a presentation at a local meetup about your open source code. This will drive community engagement with your code. We've found these groups are responsive to having members from the City teams speak. Additionally, these meetings serve as an excellent recruiting tool for getting help with a project or just new ideas.

Some meetups: 

* [Hack for LA](http://hackforla.org) 
* [LA Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/RMDS_LA/) 
* [LA Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/socalpython/)
* [LA PHP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/laphpdev/)
* [JS.LA](http://js.la/)
* [Hacks/Hackers]()

## Licensing
The City does not mandate publishing under a specific license. We support using Apache, GPL, or MIT licenses for software. For non-software content that you want to open source, please use a [cc-by](https://choosealicense.com/non-software/) license. Please check [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) for more details on this, or other options that make sense in a particular case.

## Logistics 
### Github
The City supports a shared [Github organization](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles) under the heading organization "CityOfLosAngeles". It is collectively adminsitrated by its users. We recommend that you publish code and use repositories under the organization, rather than fracturing it by using personal accounts. Contact [Hunter Owens](mailto://hunter.owens@lacity.org) or [Maryam Abbassi](mailto://maryam.abbassi@lacity.org) to get started. 

For organizing Github, please open a SNOW ticket with the CloudOps team. 

Additionally, a department may wish to create an independent organization instead of publishing on the main CityOfLosAngeles page. If so, please make sure to comply with the policies laid out in [the Reuse Section](./reuse.html). However, we encourage using a shared organization with many different teams to controll access and push rights. 

### Checklist
Before open-sourcing a project, we recommend completing the City's open source [checklist](./checklist.md).
