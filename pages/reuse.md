## Government-Wide Code Reuse


Ensuring City-wide reuse rights for custom code that is developed using City funds has numerous benefits for local stakeholders.
To realize these benefits, agencies must comply with the following requirements:

### A. Secure Rights for Government Reuse and Ensure Delivery of Source Code

Departments that enter into contracts for the custom development of software can acquire and enforce rights sufficient to enable city-wide reuse of custom-developed code.
Departments must ensure appropriate contract administration and use of best practices to secure the full scope of the City's rights,
including—but not limited to—sharing and using the code with other Deparments.
Typically, this is done via contract-copyright holding via an approved License.

Additionally, in order to ensure the ability to exercise these rights,
departments should use best practices to ensure delivery of the custom-developed code, documentation,
and other associated materials from the developer throughout the development process.

### B. Inventory All Custom-Developed Code and Make It Available Government-Wide

Using Github, the city shall publish a code repository of all avaliable projects and publish it on appropriate channels, including presentations at ITPC. 

## Maximizing Community Involvement and Reuse

Active involvement from the open source community is integral to the success of open source code. The City of Los Angeles aspires to be an active contributor to FOSS projects that it or its residents utilize.

The City shall not transfer ownership / copyright of code away from the City without explicit authorization. However, employees shall be free to contribute to other open source code on behalf of the City. If an employee is asked to sign a contributing agreement to partipate in a project, they shall contact the relevent City Attorney to sign on behalf of the city, rather than sign as an invididual. 

## Distribution of Code

There is a misconception that FOSS that is distributed to the public should not be integrated or modified for use in sensitive systems. On the contrary, FOSS is often preferred for use in sensitive systems, due in part to its increased auditability. In other words, security in FOSS must be designed never to rely on obscurity in how the code works.

In addition, while open source licenses permit the user to modify FOSS for internal use without obligating them to distribute source code to the public, when the user chooses to distribute the modified FOSS outside the user's organization, then the code is subject to whatever license it carries.
