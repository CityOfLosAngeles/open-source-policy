## Government-Wide Code Reuse


Ensuring City-wide reuse rights for custom code that is developed using City funds has numerous benefits for local stakeholders. To realize these benefits, agencies must comply with the following requirements:

### A. Secure Rights for Government Reuse and Ensure Delivery of Source Code

Departments that enter into contracts for the custom development of software can acquire and enforce rights sufficient to enable city-wide reuse of custom-developed code. Departments must ensure appropriate contract administration and use of best practices to secure the full scope of the City's rights, including—but not limited to—sharing and using the code with other Deparments. Typically, this is done via contract-copyright holding via an approved License.  	

Additionally, in order to ensure the ability to exercise these rights, departments should use best practices to ensure delivery of the custom-developed code, documentation, and other associated materials from the developer throughout the development process.

### B. Inventory All Custom-Developed Code and Make It Available Government-Wide

Using Github, the city shall publish a code repository of all avaliable projects and publish it on appropriate channels, including presentations at ITPC.
